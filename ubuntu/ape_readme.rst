On ubuntu, most of the core packages I need - both apt and pip stuff -
are installable via the ape.py script in the ape repository.

At some point, I should probably either convert that to a bash script and
put it here, or find a way to translate this repository into python
(which would then probably allow me to automatically detect mac vs linux).
